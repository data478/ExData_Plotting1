plot*.R scripts here are drivers organized as follows:
	- call data loading
	- set up graphics device and define output file
	- call plotting routine(s)

some plots, such as Global Active Power and Energy sub metering are produced using
exactly the same code for both the individual plot and the multi-plot (plot4).

this is the reason the plots differ in minor ways from the reference plots.  i
could have reproduced the reference plots exactly, but i find this to be more
consistent and better from the software engineering aspect.

dataset is in subdirectory 'data'.

data loading and plotting implemented as separate R scripts in subdirectory
'scripts', that can be tested (almost) independently of png generation.

you can regenerate the .png files by running the runall.sh script.
