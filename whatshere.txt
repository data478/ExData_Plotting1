plot*.R scripts here are drivers organized as follows:
	- call data loading
	- set up graphics device and define output file
	- call plotting routine(s)

dataset is in subdirectory 'data'

data loading and plotting implemented as separate R scripts in subdirectory
'scripts', that can be tested (almost) independently of png generation

you can regenerate the .png files by running the runall.sh script
